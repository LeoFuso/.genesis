# Genesis

A quick way to bootstrap a development environment.

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY_PATH='/media/some/path.key'
chmod +x genesis.sh
./genesis.sh

### Or

chmod +x genesis.sh
./genesis.sh '/media/some/path.key'
```

This project is just a convenience and was made with personal use in mind, but feel free to 
copy it. Go nuts.
